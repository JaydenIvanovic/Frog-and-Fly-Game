UNITY:
- Add an obstacle avoidance steering behaviour (I believe the specs ask for this). Michael: Could we make the snakes avoid the bubbles?
- Add a score for drowned snakes

Nice to have:
- Stop snakes laying eggs in the lakes
- Add a mute option to the start screen


WRITE UP:
- Explain jolty snake rotation
- Credit the dude I took the binary heap from (and explain that C sharp does not have one...)
- Explain why the binary heap made much more difference to A* vanilla than JPS
