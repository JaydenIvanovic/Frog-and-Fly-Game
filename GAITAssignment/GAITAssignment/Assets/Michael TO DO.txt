UNITY:
- Add music with option for on/off
- Make it so eggs cannot be laid at choke points, cos that will screw A*!
- Add an obstacle avoidance steering behaviour (I believe the specs ask for this)

WRITE UP:
- Explain jolty snake rotation
- Credit the dude I took the binary heap from (and explain that C sharp does not have one...)
- Explain why the binary heap made much more difference to A* vanilla than JPS
