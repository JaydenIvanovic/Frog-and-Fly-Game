# For the group

Make sure to follow the instructions at http://kleber-swf.com/the-definitive-gitignore-for-unity-projects/
before pushing up any changes. i.e. do the following:

1)Inside Unity, go to Edit >Project Settings > Editor

2)On Version Control, choose either Visible Meta Files or Hidden Meta Files. 
The difference is only if the files will be hidden on Explorer or not.

3)If you have Unity3D Pro, optionally you can change the Asset Serialization mode to Force Text too.
